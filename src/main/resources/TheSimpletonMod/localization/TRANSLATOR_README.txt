[Note to translators]

If you want to translate this mod to your language, please follow these steps :

1. Make a directory with your 3-digit language code.
2. Copy all .json files in eng/ directory to your directory.
3. Translate!
4. Add your language code to getLanguageString() function in src/main/java/thesimpleton/TheSimpletonMod.java.
5. Build the repository to generate .jar files of this mod.
6. Test it by yourself - make sure it does not have any problem during gameplay (e.g. text is truncated).
7. Send me a pull request, and then I'll merge it to the main branch.
8. If step 4-7 are difficult to you, just send me the translated .json files (though I cannot guarantee that they will work without any problem).

Thanks.
